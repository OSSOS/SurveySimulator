This directory contains the pointing history, efficiency functions for each
block of OSSOS, and the list of detected objects in two files (OSSOS.detections
and OSSOS.CDS).

The content of this directory is:

OSSOS
   \--------- README.ossos (this file)  Describes the content of the directory
    \--------- README.format            Describes format of a survey "block"
     \-------- pointings.list           List of pointings and times of the
      \                                 survey, often grouped into chunks.
       \------ 201ySn.eff               Efficiency functions for blocks,
        \                               where y gives the year (201y), S (a
         \                              single letter) semester, and n the
          \                             block name (eg, E, O, L, H)
           \- OSSOS_v11.detections      List of objects really detected in
           |                            OSSOS, with their dynamical class if
           |                            known, magnitude at detection, rate
	   |                            of motion, H mag, and more.
            \- OSSOS_v11.CDS            Same as OSSOS_v11.detections, in CDS
                                        format.
