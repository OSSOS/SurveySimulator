# This is the OSSOS survey description file.
#
# All lines starting with '#' are ignored, so they are used for comments
#
# Each data line has the format:
# <width> <height> <RA> <DEC> <epoch> <filling_factor> <tracked_fraction> \
#   <obs_code> <efficiency_file_name>
#
# <width>: width of FOV, in degree
# <height>: height of FOV, in degree
# <RA>: Right Ascension of pointing, decimal degree or HH:MM:SS[.ss...]
# <DEC>: Declination of pointing, decimal degree or DD:MM:SS[.ss...]
# <epoch>: epoch of pointing, in Julian day (decimal)
# <filling_factor>: filling factor of that FOV
# <obs_code>: observatory code
# <efficiency_file_name>: name of efficiency file for that pointing
#
# For Megaprime, the 36 CCDs are 2048x4612 with pixels 0.18689x0.18689", so
# assuming a total footprint of 1 sq.deg, the filling factor is 0.9164
#
# 2013A-E block
#
# From JJ's e-mail on Dec. 2nd, 2014, there were 7 chips out of 756 that had
# a PSF problem, thus the pipeline did not run to the end. All other cases
# had good trans.jmp files and completed correctly. So effective surface
# area is 749/756 = 99.07%, so filling factor is 0.9907*0.9164=0.9079

# From my own work and from JJ's e-mail from Nov. 30th, 2014, there were 9
# chips out of 756 which had bad trans.jmp files. So the effective search area
# was 747/756 = 98.81% of the total area, so the filling factor is

#
# From checking the vtags of Lblock_redo, only 20 fields were searched, and out
# of the 720 chips, 1 had problems at step2 which propaged to step3 and
# combine. So effective surface area is 719/720 = 99.86% of the total area, so
# filling factor is 0.9986*0.9164 = 0.9151

# Here we use the 'polygon search' feature. Make sure we remove the 1
# sq.deg. field that was not searched, at the bottom of the central column.

# 2014B-H block
#
# From checking the vtags of Hblock, I find only 751 chips successful out of
# 756 (my e-mail to JJ from Nov. 30, 2015). In the same time, JJ find only 2
# faulty chips. Until I get an answer from him, I'll stick to my findings.
# So effective surface area is 751/756 = 99.34% of the total area, so
# filling factor is 0.9986*0.9164 = 0.9103
#
# This is using the new feature (as of 2016-03-09) of polygons to describe the
