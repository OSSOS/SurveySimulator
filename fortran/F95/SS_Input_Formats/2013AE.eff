# As of 2015-08-07, we realised that measured magnitudes had changed for E
# block, in particular due to change in zeropoint when going from level 1
# to level 3. The new zeropoint are on average 0.02 mag larger than before.
# Hence the magnitude term in the square_param lines below have been
# offset by that amount (the old values are kept in comments).
