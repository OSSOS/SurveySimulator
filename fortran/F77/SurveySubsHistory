c
c Survey Simulator set of routines, version 2.0 for OSSOS
c
c Based on SurveySim.f from CFEPS, as of 2013-01-15
c
c Improvements include use of new efficiency and pointings file format,
c various efficiency functions for a given pointing as a function of rate of
c motion and colors for simulated objects such that surveys have not been
c shifted in magnitude to a common filter.
c
c 2013-04-26: Modified GetSurvey, read_sur and read_eff to read in new
c             efficiency and pointings files.
c             Modified eta_raw to support multiple efficiency functions as
c             functions of rate of motion.
c             Modified detect1 to add a 'color' array in the argument list to
c             account for colors of objects and various filters used in the
c             surveys, and change the sequence of rejections to:
c               - Check app. mag. against limiting mag.
c               - Check FOV
c               - Check for filling factor
c               - Check rate of motion
c               - Check efficiency on randomized mag.
c               - Check for tracking
c
c 2013-05-03: Added two more arguments at end of list of detect1: 'ic' for the
c             index of the color of the detection filter, and 'surna', a
c             3-character string with the name of the survey that detected the
c             object.
c             Updated content of efficiency files for CFEPS to eliminate
c             remaining inconsistancies.
c
c 2013-05-08: Changed name of entry subroutine from detect1 to detos1.
c
c 2013-07-01: Modified API for detos1 to return a single COMMENTS string
c             argument and an integer NCHAR specifying how many characeter to
c             output.
c
c 2013-09-18: Changed API of detos1 to return intrinsic mag and averaged
c             randomized mag instead of randomized mag and dmag.
c             Changed algorithm to check efficiency based on intrinsic
c             mag, using full efficiency function down to 1%, and finally
c             reject object if averaged randomized mag is fainter than
c             40% limit.
c             Discarded use of eta_trust.
c
c 2015-01-12: Changed API of detos1 to return surmized absolute magnitude
c             obtained from averaged randomized mag. Hx and m_int are returned
c             in the band filter used for the H distribution (X), while m_rand
c             and H_rand are returned in the band filter of the survey the
c             object is detected in.
c
c 2016-03-16: Changed detos1 to use 'poly', 'ears' or 'rect' labels instead of
c             the old width and height numbers in pointings.list to define the
c             FOV footprint. This allows for general polygons, or 40 CCD
c             MegaPrime specific FOV. The routine is still compatible with the
c             old input files.
c
c 2016-05-04: Continue looping on pointings until object is detected,
c             characterized and tracked. Don't stop at first detection.
c
c 2017-06-25: Increased the maximum number of pointings in 'pointings.list'
c             file to allow Schwamb et al. (2010) survey. Increased n_sur_max
c             from 1000 to 3000, and reduced n_bin_max from 100 to 30 to save
c             storage space.
