Keplerian Elements for Approximate Positions of the Major Planets

This page contains sufficient information and data to allow computation
of approximate positions for the planets. Formulae are provided in a PDF
document <https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/aprx_pos_planets.pdf> due to the
inability of HTML to effectively format mathematical expressions. Tables
containing the required Keplerian elements are provided in plain ASCII
text format to allow for both human and machine readability.

You are reminded that these formulae and data provide /approximate/
positions for the planets. They should /not/ be used unless the errors
(tabulated below) are acceptable for your application. High precision
ephemerides for the planets are available via our HORIZONS
<https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons> system.

      Formulae for Computing Approximate Planetary Positions

Lower accuracy formulae for planetary positions have a number of
important applications when one doesn't need the full accuracy of an
integrated ephemeris. They are often used in observation scheduling,
telescope pointing, and prediction of certain phenomena as well as in
the planning and design of spacecraft missions.

Approximate positions of the major planets and Pluto may be found by
using Keplerian formulae with their associated elements and rates. Such
elements are not intended to represent any sort of mean; they are simply
the result of being adjusted for a best fit. As such, it must be noted
that the elements are not valid outside the given time-interval over
which they were fit.

Since the combination of HTML with the large number of web browsers
currently available do not render mathematical expressions reliably, the
document <https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/aprx_pos_planets.pdf> containing
the formulae and data required to compute approximate planetary
positions is formatted as a PDF document
<https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/aprx_pos_planets.pdf>.


      Keplerian Elements

The data required for use in these formulae are available both in the
above referenced PDF document
<https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/aprx_pos_planets.pdf> and as ASCII plain
text files (see below). There are two ASCII tables containing the
Keplerian mean elements appropriate for specified time spans:

  * Keplerian elements for 1800 AD to 2050 AD
    <https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/p_elem_t1.txt>
  * Keplerian elements for 3000 BC to 3000 AD
    <https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/p_elem_t2.txt>
